<h1> Leonardo da Vinci</h1>
<p>Leonardo da Vinci lived during the late 15th Century and early 16th Century in and around Italy. He was a painter, a scientist, an inventor, and an engineer. He is considered by historians to be a natural genius. Today he is best remembered for his art, especially the "Mona Lisa" and the "Last Supper".</p>

<p>The Mona Lisa is a likely a portrait of the wife of a Florentine merchant. For some reason however, the portrait was never delivered to its patron, and Leonardo kept it with him when he went to work for Francis I, the King of France. The Mona Lisa's mysterious smile has inspired many writers, singers, and painters.</p>

<p>The Last Supper was given by Jesus, to the Church, as a symbolic reminder of His saving work for us, through His death on the cross. The Last Supper is symbolic. It is a channel through which we are reminded of the saving grace we have received.</p>

<p>The Lady with an Ermine is a portrait painting by the Italian Renaissance artist Leonardo da Vinci. Dated to c. 1489–1491, the work is painted in oils on a panel of walnut wood. Its subject is Cecilia Gallerani, a mistress of Ludovico Sforza ("Il Moro"), Duke of Milan; Leonardo was painter to the Sforza court in Milan at the time of its execution. It is the second of only four surviving portraits of women painted by Leonardo, the others being Ginevra de' Benci, La Belle Ferronnière and the Mona Lisa.</p>
